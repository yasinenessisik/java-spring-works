## Storing Images: Database vs Filesystem

Storing images in a database versus a filesystem involves different approaches, each with its own advantages and drawbacks:

1. **Database**:
    - **Structured storage**: Storing images in a database allows for structured storage along with other related data. This can be beneficial if you need to associate images with metadata or other information, like tags, categories, or user data.
    - **Search and retrieval**: Databases typically offer robust querying capabilities, making it easier to search for and retrieve specific images based on various criteria.
    - **Transaction support**: Databases often provide transactional support, ensuring data integrity and consistency when dealing with multiple operations.
    - **Security**: Databases can offer granular access control, allowing you to restrict access to images based on user roles or permissions.

   However, there are some drawbacks:
    - **Performance**: Storing large binary data like images in a database can impact performance, especially as the size of the database grows.
    - **Scalability**: Scaling databases to handle large volumes of images can be challenging and may require careful planning and optimization.
    - **Storage space**: Databases can consume more storage space compared to filesystem storage, especially when storing large numbers of images.

2. **Filesystem**:
    - **Simplicity**: Storing images in the filesystem is straightforward and easy to implement. Each image is typically stored as a file in a directory structure.
    - **Performance**: Filesystem access can be faster for serving static content like images, especially when using caching mechanisms.
    - **Scalability**: Filesystems are often more scalable than databases for storing large numbers of files, as they can leverage features like sharding and distributed file systems.
    - **Storage efficiency**: Filesystems can be more efficient in terms of storage space utilization compared to databases, especially for large binary files like images.

   However, filesystem storage also has its limitations:
    - **Lack of structure**: Storing images in a filesystem lacks inherent structure, making it more challenging to associate metadata or perform complex queries.
    - **Limited search capabilities**: Filesystems typically offer limited search capabilities compared to databases, making it harder to find specific images based on metadata.
    - **Security**: Filesystem security mechanisms are often less granular compared to databases, making it harder to control access to individual images.

### File System Operations

This API provides file upload and download operations both to the database and the file system.

#### File Upload (To Database)

- **URL**: `/image`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameter**: `image` (MultipartFile)
- **Description**: This endpoint uploads a file to the database.

#### File Download (From Database)

- **URL**: `/image/{fileName}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `fileName` (String)
- **Description**: This endpoint downloads a specific file from the database.

#### File Upload (To File System)

- **URL**: `/image/fileSystem`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameter**: `image` (MultipartFile)
- **Description**: This endpoint uploads a file to the file system.

#### File Download (From File System)

- **URL**: `/image/fileSystem/{fileName}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `fileName` (String)
- **Description**: This endpoint downloads a specific file from the file system.

#### File Deletion (From File System)

- **URL**: `/image/fileSystem/{fileName}`
- **Method**: DELETE
- **Parameter**: `fileName` (String)
- **Description**: This endpoint deletes a specific file from the file system.

#### File Update (In File System)

- **URL**: `/image/fileSystem/{fileName}`
- **Method**: PUT
- **Parameter**: `fileName` (String), `image` (MultipartFile)
- **Description**: This endpoint updates a specific file in the file system.
